* [Automotive Connectivity](https://github.com/EdoardoTorrini/ExamAbstract/tree/master/AC)
    * Module 1: The first module takes care of the internal vehicle system (inter-vehicular communications). It studies the sensors type, the vehicle hardware architecture, and the application domains in which the sensors and each particular device operate. Together with the architecture, also the typical vehicular signal bus will be studied. We will investigate several protocols: CAN, CAN-FD, LIN, FlexRay, MOST and Automotive Ethernet
    * Module 2: The second module takes care of inter-vehicular communications, i.e., the communications between the vehicle and the external world. It studies the protocol suite and the communication standards used to manage communications between vehicles and between a vehicle and the internet. Protocols studied: GPS, Bluetooth, LoRa, and IEEE 802.11p. Even in this case, the focus will be on the applications on top of the communication system, emphasizing the broadcast messages.
